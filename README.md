 "DESCRIPTION"

 This Python-based weather dashboard fetches, processes, and visualizes 5-day forecast data for Bengaluru using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides a comprehensive weather dashboard with interactive visualizations, making it useful for weather monitoring, data analysis, and reporting. It combines data engineering, API integration, and visualization to deliver actionable weather insights.
Tools & Technologies Used
  1.	Python (Core Language) – The script is written in Python, leveraging its powerful data handling and visualization libraries.
  2.	OpenWeatherMap API – Used to fetch real-time weather forecast data (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and weather conditions). OpenWeatherMap’s 5-day/3-hour Forecast API (Free tier supports 1,000 calls/day).
  3.	Pandas – For data processing and structuring the weather data into a DataFrame.
  4.	Matplotlib & Seaborn – For generating high-quality visualizations (line plots, bar charts, and pie charts).
  5.	Requests – To make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
  6.	Datetime – For handling and formatting date-time data.
Development Environment (VS Code)
  This script was developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular code editor known for its Python support, debugging tools, and extensions. Key features used in VS Code include:
  •	Python Extension – For IntelliSense (auto-completion), linting, and debugging.
  •	Jupyter Notebook Integration – Useful for testing visualizations interactively.
  •	Git Integration – For version control and collaboration.
  •	Terminal & Debug Console – To execute the script and check API responses.
Where Can This Script Be Used?
  1.	Weather Monitoring & Reporting
    o	Ideal for meteorologists, researchers, or weather enthusiasts who need a quick overview of Bengaluru’s weather trends.
    o	Can be scheduled to run daily (via cron jobs or Task Scheduler) to generate automated weather reports.
  2.	Travel & Tourism Industry
    o	Hotels, travel agencies, and event planners can use this dashboard to predict weather conditions for better planning.
    o	Useful for tourists checking weather forecasts before visiting Bengaluru.
  3.	Agriculture & Farming
    o	Farmers can analyze humidity and temperature trends to make irrigation and crop management decisions.
  4.	Educational & Research Projects
    o	Students learning data analysis, API integration, or Python visualization can use this as a practical example.
    o	Researchers studying climate patterns can modify the script for deeper analysis.
  5.	Business & Logistics
    o	Delivery services can monitor wind speed and weather conditions to optimize routes.
    o	Outdoor businesses (e.g., construction, event management) can plan activities based on forecasts.

Key Features of the Script
  •	Automated Data Fetching – Pulls 5-day/3-hour forecast from OpenWeatherMap.
  •	Interactive Visualizations – Includes temperature trends, humidity-pressure charts, wind speed analysis, and weather condition distribution.
  •	Customizable – Can be adapted for other cities by changing the CITY parameter.

Visualizations:
  •	Temperature Trends (Line chart with markers).
  •	Humidity vs. Pressure (Dual-axis plot).
  •	Wind Speed (Grouped bar chart by hour).
  •	Weather Conditions (Pie chart with % labels).

Who Should Use This?
  •	Developers: Learn API integration + visualization.
  •	Data Analysts: Template for time-series weather analysis.
  •	Businesses: Cost-effective alternative to commercial weather APIs.

  Final Thoughts
    This script is a versatile, ready-to-use tool for anyone needing automated weather insights for Bengaluru. It demonstrates API integration, data processing, and visualization in Python, making it a great learning resource for beginners and intermediate coders.
